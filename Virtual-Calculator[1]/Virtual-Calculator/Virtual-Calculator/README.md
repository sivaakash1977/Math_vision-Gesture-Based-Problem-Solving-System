### Project Title: AI-Powered Virtual Calculator

**Description:**

The Virtual Calculator leverages advanced AI technology and Googleâ€™s Gemini API to solve complex mathematical problems drawn by users through hand gestures. This innovative project utilizes OpenCV for capturing user inputs via a camera, translating hand-drawn equations into visual data. The image is then processed and sent to Google's Gemini model, which interprets the visual content and returns detailed, step-by-step solutions.

This calculator empowers users to interact naturally, using hand gestures to input equations such as integrals, polynomials, or geometric shapes. The project demonstrates the power of combining computer vision and generative AI to create a seamless, intuitive experience for solving math problems in real-time.

**Features:**
- Hand gesture recognition using OpenCV.
- Integration with Google Gemini API for AI-powered math problem-solving.
- Real-time equation solving and detailed output generation.
- Multimodal inputs (both image and text) for a richer user experience.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python
- OpenCV
- Google Generative AI (Gemini API)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

**Usage:**
Users can draw math problems using their hands in front of the camera, and the system will process the image, send it to Gemini API, and display the result.
